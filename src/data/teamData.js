  story: "PCB Foundation was founded in 2015 by a group of conservation scientists, business leaders, and community activists who saw the urgent need for a new model of environmental action. Traditional conservation often operated in isolation—scientists worked alone, corporations pursued sustainability in silos, and communities were left out of decisions about their own lands. We knew there had to be a better way. Our founders brought together their diverse expertise to create an organization that bridges these worlds. We combine rigorous scientific research with business acumen and deep respect for local knowledge. Today, PCB Foundation operates in 45 countries, protecting millions of hectares of critical habitat while improving livelihoods for thousands of communities. Our work has been recognized by the United Nations, featured in leading scientific journals, and supported by some of the world's most forward-thinking companies. But we're just getting started.",
